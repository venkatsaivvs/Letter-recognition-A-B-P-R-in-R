# Recognizing-letters-A-B-P-R-in-R
Built a CART model and a Random forest model that uses statistics of images of four letters in the Roman alphabet -- A, B, P, and R -- to predict which letter a particular image corresponds to.
Interpreting the results of these two models resulted in the following conclusion.
Accuracy of random forest model is significantly higher than the value for CART, 
highlighting the gain in accuracy that is possible from using random forest models.
Both the models are built in R.
